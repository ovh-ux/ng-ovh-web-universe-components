We extracted all the components of the [web control panel](https://github.com/ovh-ux/ovh-manager-web) in order to interconnect them
both in our upcoming [monorepo](https://github.com/ovh-ux/manager) but also in the current stack.

At the end we are planning remove this repository and privilege the management of sources directly
inside the monorepo.
